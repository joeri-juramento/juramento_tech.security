### Itty bitty details

Notice that Passwordless login is most of the time is equivalent to not needing to type in password nor the username! Imagine the effort and errors saved if people don't have to type in their password or their username.
(Power users might need to pick a username from a list in case of multiple identities.)

## Background information | Why this table?

Paragraphs have been made <u>**skim-compatible** ü§ì, read headers and underlined part to get the **gist**</u>.

The table helps me identify those must-enter-password dialogs and keep an eye on the progress of FIDO2/Security key support. I could not find this information elsewhere.

### Cause of Quest

I have been a YubiKey user for some time, but the FIDO2 support was added in the later models. I started this 'quest' to experience and test the benefit of Passwordless logon, but also for my parents because they are becoming of age and <u>passwords, pins and secrets are **overwhelming**</u> them. Additionally more users around me could benefit from Passwordless login because that are simply not a fan (or capable) of remembering passwords.

Personally I have been getting by with a **Password-vault**, but managing such a vault is not for everyone. I have observed <u>**users struggling** because of application complexity or human-error</u> by not being precise. 

#### Bandaid Design

Though very potentially very useful, a password manager or vault is a bandaid design solution to the negative cascade effect of the world of Passwords. Passwords try to solve the problem of secure authentication / identification. If you are reading this you know that <u>passwords are not solving that problem most elegantly</u> even though historically it makes total sense we (humans) started there. 

I think Passwordless (or Credential-less) logons are the next generation of authentication where there is no (encrypted) shared secret between client-user and server like a password (which can be stolen, re-used, shared etc). I recognise Steve Gibson's SQRL technology and <u>Yubico's & Microsoft's **FIDO2** integration as such next-generation technologies</u>. This article focuses on Security Key authentication.

### Today

Using a <u>YubiKey (5+) or Security Key is a Passwordless option that is **available today**</u>, though, as you might have surmised from this article ‚Äì referencing the big table ‚Äì <u>it is not integrated yet as seamless as one would desire</u>, but hopefully support will continue to grow. At the moment, one cannot give the user a serviced Yubikey, without sharing the account password because the Yubikey-authentication is not supported on every contact-point in the Microsoft services world. <u>The **Password remains mandatory** in some situations.</u> (Timestamped statement 8th of August, 2020)

#### Transition

We have been using physical keys to open our homes for decades, but in the digital world it has been "something you know" in stead of "something you have". I think the transition to something physical (can also be on your phone) can solve the problem of authentication or at least make the interaction more pleasant and costing less effort while being more secure. 

> *"If the key only works on 90% of the service-contact-points, it is not a replacement of a password."*

The tricky part will be the last 10%. <u>If the key only works on 90% of the service-contact-points, **it is not a replacement of a password**</u>, it is a contextual available alternative path... meaning that it works most of the times, but not always, resulting in user frustration. Furthermore, you just added complexity by needing the user to remember three different authentication methods. 

#### Current status quo

That being said, if you (or your users) can get passed the one-time mandatory password setups, <u>one could balance Passwordless logins **between the Authenticator app and the Security Key** as long as mobile platforms[^or-other] do not support FIDO2[^CTAP] yet</u> (timestamped, 8th of August 2020). Additionally, on platforms where the Security Key logon is supported, please take note that <u>the Security Key logon option is **not presented as the default or an equal alternative** in the graphical user interface</u> and if the user is not educated or informed, the user will type in their e-mail address and go the authenticator push-route in stead of the FIDO2 Security Key route which requires them clicking on an alternative button below the e-mail address field. Take a look:

[^or-other]: Or an application or a package or server support or service-provider-support or whatever in the chain that needs to be aligned for FIDO2 keys to work on mobile devices.  ‚Ü©
[^ctap]: Apparently there is CTAP version 1.1 and 2.0; the last one is required for Passwordless login. I might add more information, at the moment my mental model of FIDO2 and the relation to CTAP2.0 is not complete. I learned about these trying to figure out why Security Key logon on Mac in Firefox and Safari is not working, but Brave, Edge for Mac are supporting the Security Key. It is still a bit confusing to me to be honest. Check it out here:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530370

![ms-logon-securitykey-button-marked](ms-logon-securitykey-button-marked.png)

In this screenshot the Security Key option is presented as a *depended alternative path*, meaning the lay-out / design of the screen may cause the user to:

* fill-out their e-mail, hit enter and be confronted with a password prompt or push prompt. Completely skipping or missing the FIDO2 logon.
* fill-out their be-mail before clicking *"Sign in with security key"*. But filling out the e-mail is not required for the Security Key. The complete identity is on the Security Key! 

We are not required to fill out anything here, which is why this screen-design might steer the user the wrong way. **<u>The key logon experience must be updated** to improve the experience, but this is what we have got to work with today</u>. I need to mention it, because technical support and integration is not the only thing that has to be overcome. High quality, well-designed interactions and screens should not be taken lightly as I predict a direct link to adoptability.

##### Remnants of the Password

Currently <u>Security Keys that support FIDO2 require a **PIN**</u> (which is required by the spec if I remember correctly). So the user is not completely off the hook for needing to remember something, however, the complexity is lower than a 25-digit password, because the PIN is used for non-brute-forceable authentication from the physical user to the physical device so that the linked digital device can authenticate the (digital) user to a service-provider. I want to have mentioned the user experience or usability of this so-called "chain of authentication"[^grc-pin-auth] and its implications, because <u>unfortunately the devil's advocate might argue oversimplified[^simply] that **we just moved the password instead of replacing it**.</u>

[^grc-pin-auth]: Thanks to Steve Gibson's Security Now Podcast for educating me about authentication. His explanation of SQRL and authenticating towards the SQRL application inspired this phrasing.
[^simply]: 'oversimplifiedly' right? I simply didn't want people to trip over the words as I did. - In any case, to de-simplify: one also requires to have possession of the key and connect the key and touch the key, so there is more going then replacing a password with a PIN.

We go trough all this trouble of replacing passwords (and usernames) for a physical key which has great security improvements but a PIN of 6 to 10 characters can also become an usability issue (for some). Just try to scale it and add time.  A potential future with 3 Security Keys per user with each a different PIN? 

##### A Fingerprint Touch

So how to mitigate that sub-optimal direction? Well, [YubiKey Bio](https://www.yubico.com/blog/yubico-reveals-first-biometric-yubikey-at-microsoft-ignite/) which is on the horizon <u>might also overcome this PIN-requirement by replacing it with a **built-in fingerprint-reader**</u>. Hopefully the bio-sensor can also be powered via NFC so our functional desire to authenticate on a mobile device can also be answered.

For now, let's just wait for this product to hit the market at an acceptable price-point. For your information, there might be other (fingerprint) vendors out there, I simply only have had experience with Yubico. - I just wanted to mention a technology that could surpass the PIN-requirement and still be FIDO2 Passwordless compatible and safe.

### Future

Now I can ask my service-providers and suppliers what exactly is blocking a certain row and have a better overview. It makes it far easier to refer to a page and row and ask what the blocking (upstream) issue is.

Do you have new information? I like to you hear from you. You can start an issue at the [source](https://go.juramento.nl/source-Matrix-Passwordless-Login) of this page.
