# The Pain Towards Passwordless*

Passwords... they have always been a challenge. For the IT professional, as well as your aunt. I've never met anyone who didn't struggle with this. Even experts using the newest technologies can still get themselves in a bind. - This article shows how new technically-impressive solutions still can have suboptimal outcomes for the end-users. 

### Ever experienced issues with passwords?

The following graph demonstrates such a loop and is a simple preview for the rest of the article:

1. Like many users, soon or later you will have too many password to remember.
1. The chaos will have negative side effects.
1. Organisation can be achieved in different ways, among them, by use of a Password Vault.
1. An techy or even Organisation might enforce Passwordless Security Keys for their users.
1. Different contexts could be loaded on the same key, but that is not without risk. Multiple Keys might be used. Either because newer ones can do a new trick, or because a new contexts is clean to setup on a separate key.

```mermaid
graph TD

1.Many_Password_Problem --> 2.Chaos --"Organize"--> 3.Vault --"Passwordless tryout"--> 4.Hardware_Security_Keys --"More contexts require different Keys or<br> the unintended creation of a skeleton key"--> 5.Many_PINs_Problem -. "results again in" .-> 2.Chaos -."Organize again".-> 3.Vault
```

### Over the years I have witnessed users struggle with:

- typing their passwords
  - touching the correct keys 
  - using capital letters correct
  - finding that symbol quickly
- remembering their passwords
- saving their passwords in password managers
- selecting their passwords
- realising that for most passwords they should copy and paste their passwords, not type them
- ‚Ä∫‚Ä∫remembering how to copy and paste 
- finishing all this before a time-out expires.
- keeping PINs from different apps, phones, devices, things-in-general apart.


### Now, different coop-mechanism :

1. They reuse passwords
2. They write down passwords (In Excel, Word, Post-its)
3. Use dates and other information that is not secret.
3. Use of unprotected password managers.
4. Use of password vaults.

## Unpacking the Passwordless Route

In the diagram below you see 4 different paths of Passwordless. 

üëâ Takeaway: No current option is truly password-free or rather 'secret-to-remember-free', all of them require some form of secret the user needs to remember.

### Adding time and reality 

Let's go down the rabbit hole and find more consequences for the user. In the graph below you see two 'reality boxes' added. 

üîë At the moment you can add a Security Key to more than one tenantsüè¢ or more than one account within the same tenant. Logging into website with FIDO2 Security Key Login works perfect and if you have multiple accounts on the key it will let you choose.

... except when you use it to login into your computer. üôà If you have your regular account and your separated admin account on the YubiKey, it might login your admin account. On the Windows login screen, you cannot 'choose' which account the Security Key logs in. You can choose the account when you type in a password or PIN, but the security chooses for you. If you have more than one configured within the same tenant: it's a gamble.

üîëüîë Then another thing, when you have only one Yubikey, it means that your logins are behind the same Security Key PIN. One PIN to protect all of them! So if you add your work, private and admin account, the Security Key itself will protect these secrets behind one single PIN. üòÖ 

üëâ If you don't like the idea that the key of your home also unlocks your office or vice versa, we arrive at the node '...accommodating more contexts or needs' as is written in the Reality box of Security Keys below. If you want to be Gandalf-wise and not have "*One Ring to Rule them All*" or rather "*One Key&PIN to Rule them all*", then perhaps you need more than one Security Key and thus more than one PIN.üêáüï≥

Now you might say: *"I have only one personal account and one work account, why should I need two keys?"* Actually, you don't need the second per se, unless you choose wanting to have a backup. If that is the limit of the complexity you're in luck. As long as you remain in that spot, you don't need to worry.

These factors will increase your need for extra Security Keys:

- Wanting a back-up key.
- Starting an extra job with its own login.
- Having admin access for different clients.
- Having admin access for you job but at a separate admin account.
- Starting your own business or side-project.
- Maintaining your own digital environment thus having a separate admin account for security reasons.
- New features for newer keys.
- Because you lost one or misplaced one.
- Feeling discomfort when you type in your Security Key PIN while a co-worker is standing next to you. 

Now besides keys, sometimes you can turn your phone into a key, with the Authenticator app from Microsoft you can register your device with an organisation-tenant and enable passwordless sign-in with your phone. I added the Reality box to this feature as well. It works...

... except if you want to register more than one account in the app. You can add the device as a second factor for multiple accounts, but to use that app to replace the password, that is limited to one account per phone only. 

üëâ That means you need to have multiple phones if you want to use this feature for more than one account.üêáüï≥

### A logical consequence

Now if we look at the update graph again, we can see a common nominator...

After the Passwords grew in numbers, we had to put them into the Vault to deal with them...

We got passwordless Security Keys and now, because one Security Key might be more of a risk than a blessing, resulting in needing different PINs...

üëâ Now I need the vault again to keep track of the different PINs. 

<img src="https://media.juramento.nl/img/are-you-freaking-kidding-me_150px.png" alt="Meme are you freaking kidding me face" align="left"/>

Now I am aware that my use case might be exceptionally more complicated than most, but the underlying critique is not depended on how many keys you have. Reality will force you to remember different PINs even if you have only one key. 

Just by adding time the need for remembering PINs will increase when you start replacing passwords for one or more Security Keys or auth devices. It's because keys got PINs, phones got PINs, tablets got PINs, apps on those mobile devices might have PINs, even once laptops might have PINs. Another example, your bank or credit card has a PIN and your Bank's app might have a PIN. 

And besides the fact it is unwise to use one PIN for all, you most likely can't:

One PIN requires four digits, the other needs 6 digits and another doesn't allow you to type in your birth year. Which brings us to:

### A painful realisation:

We add the 'Overlap' box on the right side. Please read the nodes and the arrows in bold.

We have come full circle. At least seemingly, I, the user, was in a situation in which I need to remember different secrets so I kept them safe in a Vault so I wouldn't forget them. 

Now, Security Keys or Authentictor-Apps-with-Passwordless-sigin emerged, and I thought: no more passwords. 

**They were exchanged for PINs**. 

So now I'm in a situation in which I need to remember secrets of a shorter length, but still need to keep them safe. So in the Vault they go. D√©j√† vu?!

Some devices have biometric options. Great! Unless something goes wrong and the fall-back requires the PIN/pass again and in *that* situation I've used the PIN less often and therefore is harder for me to recall. So I need to peek in the Vault again, which requires a Password to open. #fun.

Let's recap on the progress that has been made.

### Finding The Netto Benefit

We zoom in at the red & green boxes above name 'Ref1' and 'Ref2'. Let's unpack.

```

Okay, so from a technical standpoint, the progress is impressive. I've spared you, but the technology under the hood is impressive. If you want your head to hurt, look into FIDO2, CTAP2, U2F and Attestation, also a fun activity. Explain that to a regular user. Also explain why some browser will not offer the Security Key log-in method and why others do. #sigh 

The fact that FIDO2 key linked to your account is based on asymmetric key cryptography resulting in a public key not-a-secret that can be openly shared with an online service, is something that I can excited about as a techyü§ìüòé, but if I put my emulate-a-regular-user-glasses on, I don't really care that hashed passwords can leak and the Security Key's public key isn't a secret. So I'm better protected against phishing or data leaks? Snore. Now here is where my 'emulator' starts to stutter. I observe that this point of better protection/authentication, doesn't seem to motivate most people. The technology's default will decide for them what they will use. If by account creation you ask them "Which one would you like?", this argument does not motivate people to use the Security Key. (I suspect.)

üëâ Anyway, from a usability perspective, the benefit or progress is not so much: I still need to remember stuff I don't really want to remember, but the system is making me remember it (or save it) because FIDO2 requires a PIN one way or another. üî¢üî°üîí

A interesting take away from my observations:

Users struggle with typing in long complicated passwords, however PINs are not always easier. It might have a higher chance of success, but regardless, they both get forgotten or confused amongst each other and mistakes happen.

üéØ A workable, scalable alternative to passwords also needs to make progress in the user/interaction realm. Great that it increases security; but it better also increase usability. It also shouldn't be harder to use over time.


## The Effort

Now Microsoft has launched (their implementation of) passwordless login a while ago.

Here are some counter-intuitive experiences.

- To activate passwordless inside the Authenticator App, you need... a password. (Or a temporary Pass(word)). I am not the first human being seeing the irony of that. At the moment of writing the implementation of Authenticator App by Microsoft is a fancy wrapper around a password which can replace it, but in order to "get there", you need the password.

Please all count to 10 and exhale...üò§

- **So the whole onboarding procedure to Passwordless, requires passwords.**

- And if you change your password, you will break the Authenticator App's ability to help you sign-in without a password. You'll need to activate it again.

- The Security Key's login capability will not break if you change your password. 

The Security Key route, which has different form factors like a Kensington fingerprint-scanner or a YubiKey, is a semi-replacement of the password, but, in order to onboard or activate it, you need a password. In theory I could send a prepped YubiKey to the user but that would I also need to set the PIN and how do I securely share this PIN with the user? 

üëâ The experience for the user with a (Kensington) fingerprint-scanner seems wonderful, until they need the fall-back PIN.

The number of extreme happy usages before fall-back PIN is required, can be extensive. However, when the system gets into a locked state somehow, requiring that fall-back PIN, we can only hope users can access the vault where the PIN is stored if they don't remember it.

üëâ If the fall-back PIN is used rarely, that‚Äôs great, because that means that the primary authentication to the device is working; however, it also means the user used the PIN less often and is MORE likely to have forgotten it.


## Wrap up

So these Security Keys with their PINs are not the holy grail in their current implementation form. Amongst other issues, the main problem is just being moved from passwords to PINs. The authentication hardship has moved - read slowly - from a hardship between the user and a website to the user and the Security Key.

The benefits melt away simply by adding reality.

### Future

Two topics exist I would like to discuss in the future. The Authenticator app and comparing same-device auth versus multi-device auth and my observations with end-users. 

The current options seem technology-driven and we should probably take our hats off to its authors, but I want more! I want us to find that bliss point between technology, security and human user-friendly interaction.

Until next time.

# Update

### FIDO Credentials for Passwordless (May 2022)

‚ÄòPasskeys‚Äô as alternatives to traditional passwords.

Continued from previous article ‚Äú[The Pain Towards Passwordless](https://medium.com/@joeri.juramento/the-pain-towards-password-less-84aa8b8c809)‚Äù.

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YDrYzMCs1IsLknD3Bw56aA.png)Image-source: FIDO Alliance‚Äôs PDF ‚Äú[How FIDO Addresses a Full Range of Use Cases](https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-FIDO-Addresses-a-Full-Range-of-Use-Cases-March24.pdf)‚Äù

Seems that the FIDO alliance is shifting their focus from the hardware-based Security Keys to a different strategy some call ‚ÄòPasskeys‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan alias for FIDO Credentials‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin favour of better (expected) user adoption. It effectively turns a smartphone (or your laptop) into a Security Key, with extra cloud synchronisation and backup options.

This future phone with FIDO credentials can authenticate to all kinds of accounts. So you would log into your webshop.example with help of your phone, in stead of a password. You would authenticate yourself to your phone and the phone would authenticate you to the website.

Now let‚Äôs map the problem with Security Keys and their PINs to this new design see what is resolved and what isn‚Äôt.

#### 1. The Security Key‚Äôs (Fall-back) PIN

A mobile phone as such has a secret as well, on an iPhone it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòPasscode‚Äô to unlock your phone. If you enable Touch ID or Face ID, the Passcode becomes in a sense the fall-back PIN. You only need to enter it in certain contexts.

üü¢üî∏ I assume that the chance that users remember their phone PIN or passcode is higher than the fallback of their Kensington / Yubikey Bio‚Äôs fall-back PIN because the OS will prompt it more often (relatively).

For Security Key‚Äôs without fingerprint reader, the PIN is not a fall-back, but the main authentication towards the device, used every time, thus not an issue.

üü¢ If a user uses several physical Security Keys with different PINs, this new set-up of FIDO Credentials could mitigate the need for needing different Security Keys as the phone has additional protection mechanisms like tracking, remote-wipe, synchronisation and backup that a Security Key does not. However:

> If you want to be Gandalf-wise and not have ‚Äú*One Ring to Rule them All*‚Äù or rather ‚Äú*One Key&PIN to Rule them all*‚Äù, then perhaps you need more than one Security Key and thus more than one PIN.üêáüï≥

‚Åá Looking at this Gandalf-wisdom, depending on the implementation, this is a form of consolidating credentials onto one trusted device behind one secret. We‚Äôll have to wait and see, though I can state that requiring two mobile phones is not the expected solution in this new form factor. See section ‚ÄòWorries‚Äô for more.

#### 2. The dependency on the account‚Äôs Password.

üü¢ In contrast to Microsoft‚Äôs Authenticator Passwordless sign-in app breaking when you change the account‚Äôs password and you need it, to set it up, in theory, FIDO Credential exchange should be enough to set-up an account without the need for a main password. As it is a true replacement of a password, it should work completely independent of it.

It should be noted that a FIDO *Security Key* could in theory already realise that today, but I have not witnessed any of the major services offering account creation *without* a password, though outlook.live.com does offer you the option of disabling your password, including Google offers hardening in similar fashion. The difference is that these features are offered as hardening to upgrade your security whereas‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom my perspective‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFIDO Credentials alias ‚ÄòPasskeys‚Äô also focus on Usability. To get away from passwords to a more user-friendly authentication form.

#### 3. Users might need to do more steps than with a password.

Yes and no. It depends on the implementation. I am hoping less can go wrong. [At the top](https://medium.com/@joeri.juramento/the-pain-towards-password-less-84aa8b8c809) I listed about 10 different struggles users have with passwords. It would be great it that was reduced to only 1.

Microsoft‚Äôs own Authenticator App passwordless implementation is experienced differently if you authenticate something on-device compared to authenticating across different devices.

Against expectations, I‚Äôve witnessed users to have more problem with using the technology on the same device.

üëâ When a user gets a notification on the phone while logging into his account on his computer. The notification set‚Äôs the user up almost perfectly for a normal walk though. 

However, when this notification comes by when a user logs in to an app on their phone or iOS‚Äô native Contact app, I‚Äôve seen the following struggles:

1. Users do **not see**/register the notification popping over their screen.
2. Users are **too** **slow** to click it before the notification disappears.
3. Users do **not know** where to find the notification after it has disappeared.
4. After navigating to the app manually, users do **not know** how to refresh the app if needed.
5. Users work **too slow** and the sign-in the prompt has timed-out.
6. Users finally answer the prompt successfully in time, but they **don‚Äôt know** how to finish the authentication by navigation back to the account‚Äôs settings screen or the relevant app.
7. Users seem to **get disoriented** mid-flow and seem to forget what they were trying to accomplish and try start over, finding their app or setting in a weird state, **not knowing** how to reset it.
8. Users seem to have **no complete understanding** of different windows/apps on their mobile phone and how to (quickly) navigate between them.
9. Users **don‚Äôt seem to understand** that App A signs-in App B, whereas they **DO understand** App A sign-ins Desktop App 1.
10. When the app asks the user ‚Äúto Touch-ID‚Äù, they **press** the home button **too hard** interrupting the process.
11. Users **cannot see or remember the number fast enough** before it is overlayed with new screen elements. (Microsoft‚Äôs horrible implementation truly resulted in a ‚ÄòHide for 5 seconds‚Äô option to allow users to see the challenged number for this same-device issue. #bandaid-on-bandaid-on-bandaid.)

Now if users experience the same difficulty with FIDO Credentials / ‚ÄòPasskeys‚Äô as the list above, then pack your bags and go home.

It has to be borderline seamless.

Why is the Microsofts Authenticator app‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpasswordless enabled‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprompting users to enter numbers when it is on the SAME device. As long as the app is authorised, it should just continue on the user‚Äôs command without challenges.

**All these struggles are not the user‚Äôs fault!**

A. The system should **be more patient**.

B. The system should **be context-aware**.

C. The system should not need to rely on elaborate understanding by the user. ~ The system should **only rely on the minimum of platform-understanding** of the user for mainstream tasks.

D. The system should **guide and inform** the user what to do next (within reason).

E. The system **should not bother** the user with stuff that can be automated (while providing choice if needed).

So struggle 3, 6, 7.2 relate to platform knowledge (C). **The solution should not assume nor require the users to have understanding of**

- ***app-switching,\***
- ***notification-centre,\***
- ***inner-notification-answers,\***
- ***force-quit,\***
- ***pull-to-refresh\***

**because these operations can be unknown to the user.** They may facilitate alternate paths in your flow, but they should NOT be part of the regular basic course of events. If you do, you will probably lose users who cannot complete the flow. Or worse, you create a solution with a nightmare usability that people have to put up with every_single_time.

Perhaps in a few decades, this requirement will no longer be valid, I am not sure.

üëâ The main argument is that your flow shouldn‚Äôt rely on knowledge or information outside the screen or outside the active interaction between user and system.

That is why the authentication across two devices works better. Users hear and see a notification on their locked screen which just keeps waiting there until they do something with it. They interact with it and are taken to the correct app, authenticate and it its done.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSimply a better experience than the current on-device authentication. (Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless sign-in.)

‚Åáüî∏/üü¢/üü•‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe‚Äôll have to wait and see how FIDO Credentials / Passkeys get implemented.

### Worries

### So the Phone‚Äôs Passcode will protect more‚Ä¶

If the iPhone‚Äôs passcode or Touch ID become the secrets that protect the FIDO Credentials, then sharing one‚Äôs phone amongst spouses or family has more consequences than before.

I have spoken with users that know each other‚Äôs phone‚Äôs passcode. I also spoken with users that absolutely don‚Äôt share their phone‚Äôs passcodes; it‚Äôs a choice.

Regardless, if this phone will protect other accounts, platform makers might offer to protect Passcodes with an additional‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähere we go again‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPIN which the main user needs to remember again.

--

Imagine a phone with 25 FIDO Credentials of main user Bob. 5 Credentials are for work, 20 credentials are for personal resources.

Bob‚Äôs partner is Jim. If Jim knows Bob‚Äôs phone‚Äôs passcode, he has access to Bob‚Äôs work‚Äôs resources. He would need Bob‚Äôs phone and the passcode, but I can see a company admin not being happy about this on principle.

There are valid reasons for Bob and Jim to open each other‚Äôs phone, but there are also valid reasons for a company admin to state that Jim should not have access to Bob‚Äôs FIDO Credentials for work. 

I‚Äôm curious to see how this will get resolved. Will the phone become context-aware and should we create a kind of ‚Äòguest mode‚Äô on the phone, that regardless of the correct passcode being entered, the phone recognises Jim as not-main-user-Bob and prevents access to company FIDO Credentials?

I am unsure. Perhaps Bob has a password vault on his phone which unlocks with Touch ID or Face ID or the phone‚Äôs passcode, which means that Jim had already access to Bob‚Äôs work passwords even before any FIDO Credentials implementation. Does that really negate the Company‚Äôs admin's concerns?

--

I am curious to see how this will develop, but for the most simplistic use case, I am hopeful if it can replace those pesky passwords.
